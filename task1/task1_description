* Supplies to corporate, small and mid-size enterprises (SME's) and residential customers

Significant churn problem
* Driven by power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe
* Problem is largest in the SME segment

Has engaged BCG to help with the SMW segment

**Client's hypothesis**
It is possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model

Hypothesis that churn is driven by customer price sensitivity

* SME division head suggests that offering customers at high propensity to churn a 20% discount might be effective
